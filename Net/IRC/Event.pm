=head1 NAME

Net::IRC::Event - A class for passing event data between subroutines

=head1 SYNOPSIS

None yet. These docs are under construction.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This documentation is a subset of the main Net::IRC documentation. If
you haven't already, please "perldoc Net::IRC" before continuing.

Net::IRC::Event defines a standard interface to the salient information for
just about any event your client may witness on IRC. It's about as close as
we can get in Perl to a struct, with a few extra nifty features thrown in.

=head1 METHOD DESCRIPTIONS

This section is under construction, but hopefully will be finally written up
by the next release. Please see the C<irctest> script and the source for
details about this module.

=head1 LIST OF EVENTS

Net::IRC is an entirely event-based system, which takes some getting used to
at first. To interact with the IRC server, you tell Net::IRC's server
connection to listen for certain events and activate your own subroutines when
they occur. Problem is, this doesn't help you much if you don't know what to
tell it to look for. Below is a list of the possible events you can pass to
Net::IRC, along with brief descriptions of each... hope this helps.

=head2 Common events

=over

=item *

nick

The "nick" event is triggered when the client receives a NICK message, meaning
that someone on a channel with the client has changed eir nickname.

=item *

quit

The "quit" event is triggered upon receipt of a QUIT message, which means that
someone on a channel with the client has disconnected.

=item *

join

The "join" event is triggered upon receipt of a JOIN message, which means that
someone has entered a channel that the client is on.

=item *

part

The "part" event is triggered upon receipt of a PART message, which means that
someone has left a channel that the client is on.

=item *

mode

The "mode" event is triggered upon receipt of a MODE message, which means that
someone on a channel with the client has changed the channel's parameters.

=item *

topic

The "topic" event is triggered upon receipt of a TOPIC message, which means
that someone on a channel with the client has changed the channel's topic.

=item *

kick

The "kick" event is triggered upon receipt of a KICK message, which means that
someone on a channel with the client (or possibly the client itself!) has been
forcibly ejected.

=item *

public

The "public" event is triggered upon receipt of a PRIVMSG message to an entire
channel, which means that someone on a channel with the client has said
something aloud.

=item *

msg

The "msg" event is triggered upon receipt of a PRIVMSG message which is
addressed to one or more clients, which means that someone is sending the
client a private message. (Duh. :-)

=item *

notice

The "notice" event is triggered upon receipt of a NOTICE message, which means
that someone has sent the client a public or private notice. (Is that
sufficiently vague?)

=item *

ping

The "ping" event is triggered upon receipt of a PING message, which means that
the IRC server is querying the client to see if it's alive. Don't confuse this
with CTCP PINGs, explained later.

=item *

other

The "other" event is triggered upon receipt of any number of unclassifiable
miscellaneous messages, but you're not likely to see it often.

=item *

invite

The "invite" event is triggered upon receipt of an INVITE message, which means
that someone is permitting the client's entry into a +i channel.

=item *

kill

The "kill" event is triggered upon receipt of a KILL message, which means that
an IRC operator has just booted your sorry arse offline. Seeya!

=item *

disconnect

The "disconnect" event is triggered when the client loses its
connection to the IRC server it's talking to. Don't confuse it with
the "leaving" event. (See below.)

=item *

leaving

The "leaving" event is triggered just before the client deliberately
closes a connection to an IRC server, in case you want to do anything
special before you sign off.

=item *

umode

The "umode" event is triggered when the client changes its personal mode flags.

=item *

error

The "error" event is triggered when the IRC server complains to you about
anything. Sort of the evil twin to the "other" event, actually.

=back

=head2 CTCP Requests

=over

=item *

cping

The "cping" event is triggered when the client receives a CTCP PING request
from another user. See the irctest script for an example of how to properly
respond to this common request.

=item *

cversion

The "cversion" event is triggered when the client receives a CTCP VERSION
request from another client, asking for version info about its IRC client
program.

=item *

csource

The "csource" event is triggered when the client receives a CTCP SOURCE
request from another client, asking where it can find the source to its
IRC client program.

=item *

ctime

The "ctime" event is triggered when the client receives a CTCP TIME
request from another client, asking for the local time at its end.

=item *

cdcc

The "cdcc" event is triggered when the client receives a DCC request of any
sort from another client, attempting to establish a DCC connection.

=item *

cuserinfo

The "cuserinfo" event is triggered when the client receives a CTCP USERINFO
request from another client, asking for personal information from the client's
user.

=item *

cclientinfo

The "cclientinfo" event is triggered when the client receives a CTCP CLIENTINFO
request from another client, asking for whatever the hell "clientinfo" means.

=item *

cerrmsg

The "cerrmsg" event is triggered when the client receives a CTCP ERRMSG
request from another client, notifying it of a protocol error in a preceding
CTCP communication.

=item *

cfinger

The "cfinger" event is triggered when the client receives a CTCP FINGER
request from another client. How to respond to this should best be left up
to your own moral stance.

=item *

caction

The "caction" event is triggered when the client receives a CTCP ACTION
message from another client. I should hope you're getting the hang of how
Net::IRC handles CTCP requests by now...

=back

=head2 CTCP Responses

=over

=item *

crping

The "crping" event is triggered when the client receives a CTCP PING response
from another user. See the irctest script for an example of how to properly
respond to this common event.

=item *

crversion

The "crversion" event is triggered when the client receives a CTCP VERSION
response from another client.

=item *

crsource

The "crsource" event is triggered when the client receives a CTCP SOURCE
response from another client.

=item *

crtime

The "crtime" event is triggered when the client receives a CTCP TIME
response from another client.

=item *

cruserinfo

The "cruserinfo" event is triggered when the client receives a CTCP USERINFO
response from another client.

=item *

crclientinfo

The "crclientinfo" event is triggered when the client receives a CTCP
CLIENTINFO response from another client.

=item *

crfinger

The "crfinger" event is triggered when the client receives a CTCP FINGER
response from another client. I'm not even going to consider making a joke
about this one.

=back

=head2 DCC Events

=over

=item *

dcc_open

The "dcc_open" event is triggered when a DCC connection is established between
the client and another client.

=item *

dcc_update

The "dcc_update" event is triggered when any data flows over a DCC connection.
Useful for doing things like monitoring file transfer progress, for instance.

=item *

dcc_close

The "dcc_close" event is triggered when a DCC connection closes, whether from
an error or from natural causes.

=item *

chat

The "chat" event is triggered when the person on the other end of a DCC CHAT
connection sends you a message. Think of it as the private equivalent of "msg",
if you will.

=back

=head2 Numeric Events

=over

=item *

There's a whole lot of them, and they're well-described elsewhere. Please see
the IRC RFC (1495, at http://cs-ftp.bu.edu/pub/irc/support/IRC_RFC ) for a
detailed description, or the Net::IRC::Event.pm source code for a quick list.
